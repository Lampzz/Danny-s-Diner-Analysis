### Enhance Loyalty Program:
Revamp the Loyalty Program: Analyze why non-members are spending more and revise the loyalty program to offer better incentives.
Targeted Campaigns: Offer exclusive deals and rewards for members to encourage more frequent visits and higher spending.

### Increase Engagement for Low-Visit Customers:
Introduce Delivery Service: Consider adding a delivery service to cater to Customer C and others who visit infrequently.
Personalized Offers: Send personalized offers or reminders to low-engagement customers to encourage repeat visits.

### Focus on High-Spending Customers:
Special Rewards for Top Spenders: Create exclusive benefits for top spenders like Customer A and B to maintain their loyalty and increase their spending.
Customer Feedback: Collect feedback from high-spending customers to understand their preferences and improve their dining experience.
